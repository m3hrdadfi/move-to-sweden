## ‚úàÔ∏è Before Arrival & Universal First Steps (All cities & universities)
- **Residence permit & long-term residence status**  
  - [SULF guide](https://sulf.se/en/work-salary-and-benefits/residence-permit/residence-permit/)  
  - [Migration webinar for PhDs & researchers](https://sulf.se/sulf-play/doktorand/webinar-the-enquiry-about-migration-rules-for-doctoral-candidates-and-researchers/)

- **Personnummer & ID card**
  - Mandatory everywhere.
  - You must first apply for your personnummer at Skatteverket as soon as you arrive. Bring required docs (passport, residence permit, etc.)
  - Once you receive your personnummer, then you can apply for your Swedish ID card.
  - Without these two (personnummer + ID card), you cannot open a full bank account, get BankID, or properly register for many services (including unions, insurance, etc.).
  - Online pre-registration: [Move to Sweden form](https://www7.skatteverket.se/portal/flytta-till-sverige-anmalan/skapa/bakgrund)
  - ID card booking: [Book here](https://ssc.nemoq.se/Booking/Booking/Index/SSC)
  - General procedure:
    - Book a visit or walk in to Skatteverket.
    - Submit your application for personnummer with all required docs (passport, residence permit, marriage/birth certificates if applicable, employment/admission letter).
    - Wait 2‚Äì5 weeks to receive your personnummer letter by mail.
    - After getting your personnummer, book a separate appointment for the ID card: [Book here](https://ssc.nemoq.se/Booking/Booking/Index/SSC).
    - Bring your personnummer letter and residence permit card to the appointment.
    - Wait 1‚Äì3 weeks to receive your ID card by mail.

- **Bank account & BankID**
  - Open your account with personnummer + ID. Ask for Swish and BankID on day one.
  - Each bank has different requirements and procedures. Some want extra documentation (like proof of employment or a tax decision letter), and some might even do a short interview.
  - You'll probably have to book an appointment and wait in a queue (get used to queues ‚Äî you'll see them everywhere in Sweden, and this README won't be the last time you hear about them).
  - General procedure:
    - Open your bank account (requires personnummer + ID card).
    - Request BankID and Swish setup (can usually be done same day as account opening, if approved).
    - Wait to receive your debit card (MasterCard/Visa) by post ‚Äî usually 1 week.
    - Wait for a separate letter with your card PIN code ‚Äî usually another week.
  - Without BankID, you can't use most digital services, including e-identification, Swish, many online payments, and even some university systems.
  - While waiting, use **Revolut** or get help from local friends.

- **Forsakringskassan (insurance) registration**
  - Mandatory for healthcare and social benefits.  
  - [Forsakringskassan guide](https://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatperson/flytta-till-arbeta-i-studera-i-eller-vara-nyanland-i-sverige/flytta-till-sverige)
  - Order EU health card if needed.

- **Medical registration**
  - Register at a local "v√•rdcentral" via [1177.se](https://www.1177.se/).
  - Start appointments there; 1177 is also your first phone contact for urgent care.
